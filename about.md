I graduate from [Xiamen University](http://www.xmu.edu.cn/) with a PhD degree in Theoretic Physics in 2012. I worked as a member of Soft Condensed Matter Research Lab leaded by [Professor Wu](http://biophys.xmu.edu.cn/indexen.htm). 

Between November 2009 and November 2010, I worked as a PhD research
assistant in [Professor Wangâ€™s](http://www.nanomac.uq.edu.au/lianzhou-wang) research group.

I am very interested in data analysis and machine learning related stuff since I was doing my physics PhD. In the following years, I want to work on data visualization and machine learning. If it is possible, I would like to work in startup as a data scientist.  

Now I am learning Python, Machine Learning and Algorithms on coursera. I also learn JavaScript by myself, and I wrote my first small game <a href='http://min-guo.com/tic-tac-toe/' target='_blank'>Tic-Tac_Toe</a> in JavaScript. 

Read my code on <a href='https://github.com/Min-Guo' target='_blank'>Github</a>, tweet me <a href='https://twitter.com/_Min_Guo' target='_blank'>@_Min_Guo</a>, and find me on <a href='www.linkedin.com/in/minguo1/' target='_blank'>LinkedIn</a>.
