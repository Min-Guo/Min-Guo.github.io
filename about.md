I graduate from [Xiamen University](http://www.xmu.edu.cn/) with a PhD degree in Theoretic Physics in 2012. I worked as a member of Soft Condensed Matter Research Lab leaded by [Professor Wu](http://biophys.xmu.edu.cn/indexen.htm). 

Between November 2009 and November 2010, I worked as a PhD research
assistant in [Professor Wangâ€™s](http://www.nanomac.uq.edu.au/lianzhou-wang) research group.
