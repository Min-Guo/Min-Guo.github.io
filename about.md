This is  Min, a fresher learning coding, who lives in New York at the moment.

I worked as a member of Soft Condensed Matter Research Lab leaded by
[Professor Wu](http://biophys.xmu.edu.cn/indexen.htm) in Xiamen
University. In 2012, I got my PhD degree in Theoretic Physics.

Between November 2009 and November 2010, I worked as a PhD research
assistant in [Professor Wang’s research group](http://www.nanomac.uq.edu.au/lianzhou-wang).

Read my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Min-Guo).

This theme is made by me. It is still under construction. Please sustain attention.

 You have a nice day. ♥
