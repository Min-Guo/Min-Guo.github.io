Rencently, I switch my bash shell to oh my zsh. It is a personalized and powerful shell. There is an question. Why use Zsh?

It is an simple reason for me. Oh My Zsh could show me whole path expansion as below:<br /> ![zsh-path](/images/zsh-path.jpg)<br /> 

Whole path expansion is very important, especially for who is new to program. Zsh provides only one distinct match for the file you want. It could help you not to delete your important file. Several days ago, I deleted my finished python assignment by accident. It is so sad that I have to rewrite it. Some freshers might have the same experience like me. Well, Zsh would help you prevent that situation.
